Quentin Pergeline:
(github login lafaillette) I am a french engineer with some knowledge in computer science and applied mathematics.
I am currently doing an Erasmus semester at the UPC FME, before trying to find an internship to get my diploma.

Clara Mateo
I am from Santa Perp\`etua de la Mogoda but I live in Barcelona since 2008. I studied the double degree in Mathematics and Physics in UAB. I started the master last year and I plan to finish it in June. About my professional experience, I did a Summer Scholarship in DESY, Hamburg, in 2012 and I have also worked in marketing online, creating and managing SEM in Google Adwords. Nowadays I am trying to figure out what I would like to do in the future :)
