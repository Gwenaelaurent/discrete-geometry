\section{Elisabet Burjons Pujol}

I am from Pineda de Mar, a town near Barcelona. I have studied Mathematics at UPC and Physics at UB. 
I am taking this master in order to learn more about algorithms and discrete mathematics.
My goal is to PhD in applied mathematics or theoretical computer science if possible.

My topics of interest are online algorithms, randomized algorithms and graphs,
but I like in general all kinds of discrete mathematics and combinatorics related topics.
