Quentin Pergeline:
(github login lafaillette) I am a french engineer with some knowledge in computer science and applied mathematics.
I am currently doing an Erasmus semester at the UPC FME, before trying to find an internship to get my diploma.

Jan Fiser:
I come from the Czech Republic. Last year I finished bachelor's degree in "Mathematical Methods of Information Security" at the Charles University in Prague and this academic year I am studying at UPC with the Erasmus programme.
Although I am interested more in cryptography and abstract algebra, I enrolled here, among others, for courses of discrete algebra or graph theory. I am discovering new areas of mathematics and I enjoy it.
