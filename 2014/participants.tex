Quentin Pergeline:
(github login lafaillette) I am a french engineer with some knowledge in computer science and applied mathematics.
I am currently doing an Erasmus semester at the UPC FME, before trying to find an internship to get my diploma.

Pilar Cano:
I am from Mexico, I studied mathematics at UNAM. I'm doing the master at UPC in FME. This is the first time I take a course about discrete geometry, so I do not have a lot of knowledge about it. I am interested in combinatorics and I intend to do a PHD later.
