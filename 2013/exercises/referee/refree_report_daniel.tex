\section*{Content}

  This paper talks about Bézier curves and patches. The main purpose of the paper is a generalization of the Birch's theorem, which guarantees injectivity in such curves or patches. 

\section*{Format}

  In my opinion, this article is very well written. For a reader non-expert in the matter, the reading is just in this point where the subject flows lightly without becoming even a bit hardly. The structure of the document is simple, clear and logical. Furthermore it is explained in the introduction. The quantity of examples is generous and they are were they should be. Similarly happens to the number of figures: they are clear, concise, and they are where is needed to be. Definitions are also clear and formal, without reaching redundancy. But all this is for a non-expert reader, so maybe for an expert the reading is a bit slow.
  
  In addition, it uses a funny QED symbol, what is always a plus.
