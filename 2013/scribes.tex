\section{Cecilia Girón Albert}

I've got my Degree in Mathematics at the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, I completed my fifth and sixth semesters at the University of Jyväskyla (Finland) as an Erasmus student. My degree has been mainly focused on subjects like analysis, statistics and numerical methods, although I am more interested in algebra and graph theory. 

I decided to study the Master in Advanced Mathematics and Mathematical Engineering to keep developing my mathematics skills in some theoretical subjects that can be applied in real life problems. Therefore, I believe that this course is a great opportunity to learn more about algorithmic and computing science and even more importantly, it may help me to find out what field I would like to focus on in the future.
